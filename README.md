# Evolving Code
This project is a small experiment to explore the feasibility of evolving assembly.
I have specified a simple assembly language and implemented a barebones VM to run it. The VM is designed to be as forgiving as possible of invalid input. Any completely invalid input is considered to be a NOP instruction.
